# Employee_management_system
My first time using Git. employee_management_system.py is a program that manages two employees. It allows the user to change name, ID, hourly wage, hours worked. A main menu structure is applied to make the program usable for the user

21st October 2023
Made big changes to how employees are managed in the program. 
- Instead of managing only 2 employees, a dictionary is used
to contain as many employees as the user needs. 
- Modified the addemployee() to add only 1 employee and created a newemployees() method that deletes all previously added
employees, gets how many employees the user would like to add then adds them one by one to the dictionary
